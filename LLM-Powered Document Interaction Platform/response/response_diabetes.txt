After analyzing the data, I found that:

* 14 rows have both Blood Pressure (BP) and Diabetes (Dia) values.
* The corresponding BP and Dia values for these rows are:
	+ BP: 42, 99, 102, 120, 102, 109, 140, 153, 100, 147, 81, 187, 162, 136
	+ Dia: 0.600, 2, 1, 11, 3, 1, 9, 13, 12, 1, 1, 3, 6, 4

These rows represent patients who have both blood pressure and diabetes measurements recorded.
