* A unique identifier (e.g. "4970")
* A first and last name (e.g. "Teresa Strawn")
* A gender (e.g. "Female")
* A nationality or country of origin (e.g. "France")
* An age
* A date (e.g. "21-05-2015")

The list is organized in a tabular format, with each entry on a new line and separated by a series of numbers and underscores.

There are several observations that can be made about the content:
