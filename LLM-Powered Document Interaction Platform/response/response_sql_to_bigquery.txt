Here is the equivalent SQL query in BigQuery:
```
SELECT
  DATE(purchase_date) AS date_only,
  purchase_price
FROM
  `customer_data.customer_purchase`
```
Note:

* In BigQuery, you don't need to use square brackets `[]` around table or column names.
* The `DATE()` function is used to extract the date part from a datetime value. This is equivalent to `CAST(date AS date)` in SQL Server.
* The table name and schema (`customer_data.customer_purchase`) are specified using backticks ``, which is the standard way to quote identifiers in BigQuery.

Also, if you want to run this query on a dataset named `customer_data` located in the default project, you can use:
```
SELECT
  DATE(purchase_date) AS date_only,
  purchase_price
FROM
  customer_purchase
```
Make sure to replace the table name and schema with your actual BigQuery data.
