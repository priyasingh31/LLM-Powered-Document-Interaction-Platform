Greetings,
My name is Priya Kumari, and I am currently pursuing my BTech degree in Computer Science and System Engineering at KIIT University. Alongside my technical expertise, I have actively engaged with diverse groups of individuals during college events, serving as the Director of Public Relations for the KIIT International Model United Nations. This experience has instilled in me a deep understanding of teamwork and collaboration.

Beyond academics, I have a passion for dance and a keen interest in staying updated with the latest technological advancements.

I am compelled to pursue a career in consulting as it aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations. Consulting offers a dynamic environment where I can continuously learn, grow, and make a tangible impact. It's not merely about solving complex problems but also about leveraging my expertise in energy and developing the skills necessary to become a future business leader.

The opportunity to delve into the most challenging issues faced by billion-dollar companies excites me, as I am eager to contribute meaningfully and help shape the future of business.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of exploring opportunities in consulting further and am keen to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your organization's needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly await the opportunity to connect and discuss potential collaborations.

Warm regards,
Priya Kumari
