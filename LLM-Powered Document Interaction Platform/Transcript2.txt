 speaker1 : In Delhi, if you go outside there, this is Agrawal suite. If everyone goes there, even cities maybe.
speaker2 : Correct.
speaker1 : So caste, top everyday life. Indian states say, do you consider us as a citizen? Do you consider as an equal citizen? Because society doesn't consider.
speaker2 : Alagni. Wasn't it more forward looking?
speaker1 : Therefore there's a backlog or whose backlog report IO more than 50% GST is coming from working class who is working classes in this country. Is this working class? Is this a low cost job? Joaqui Mazurikara Japon.
speaker2 : Discrimination.
speaker1 : I know one of my friend who studied in JNA. His father is is. And his father hiked to his cars to get a home after his retirement.
speaker2 : Namaste Jai Hind. You are watching or listening to another edition of the ANI podcast with Smita Prakash. My guest today is Rahul son Peblo, Dalit leader and president of the All India Independent Scheduled Cars association. The Dalit vote and Dalit issues came up in sharp focus during the elections of 2024. For those of you interested in understanding the politics of affirmative action in India, you can see episode 168 with professor Dilip Mandan. You can even watch this episode with Aakash Anand in episode 164. These two were done during the elections. This one with Rahul is being done post elections where we shall talk more in detail about the Dalit Samajdev, their assertion for identity from untouchable to Harijan to Bahujan Raoji Ani podcast political sphere Meijada information mainstream politics.
speaker1 : Jesse Apnika Mira so called mainstream politics background Satam let's say center of ambit credit politics Baba Sabka like Rajnithira Maharashtra Kunki Kutki political party compared to other part of Maharashtra social movement Washington social movement electoral politics mainstream political parties mostly led by upper caste, they have resources based Jada Bhara, Tohiya Sabna karaktu otherwise it's difficult for you to cheat. Mera graduation hua may tease me tribal social work tata issue of social science Mumbai say Mphil PhD kia or wape Hamnik Ambit Christ student moment Banaya Oruska politics Kia my election Bilal student politics mainstream Rajniki Johe attracted he believed we need to have all our own social institution because this country is ruled by the opportunity and they hardly want you to progress. And he has many statements like that. And therefore he believed to have her own autonomous institution. So he formed peoples society somehow post Ambedkar time that became the silent feature of our movement. It's not a victim card, but this is something because bastije wahapi intervention Hamaji level resources I am the beneficiary of that kind of institution or Japan since this is a political democracy unless and until you again takat lob Taptaka Kisib political party government negotiate and that's how because at the end we don't have anything to negotiate with the government. And then as I said, this is a political democracy.
speaker2 : Or ablagra change evolution.
speaker1 : Change to bilkul ayah like, you know, change moreover Yaniyaki Mujay Lagayaki movement Chaltata Jesse graduation mayharmaratam strong or wahi Kashiramji population beef Jada Shirulkaska population jada marati so wahapi hamjabi kadrakam karthi Bhatta Joy although uskbadmik bhara narrative aya jab both illiterally success panilagiki rajnik joe power that is the key of everything correct? Which is it true? Which is true. But then autonomous ambit cried politics political organization.
speaker2 : Identity katamogi specialized politics key.
speaker1 : Jab up decline both progressive and so called right wing media they both criticize BSP for, you know for very allagalag reasons digata ustragi sympathy and there are many other reason that dalit political party hair corporate owner there could be many reasons, we can analyze that but my thing is I find it their policies quite again, if there are language BGP and congress is uppercast late very aggressive kind of party congress Abhitaki change Karnaki Bhati party is kind of a party of upper caste, polite upper caste. So if you check their schedule cast they talk about economy, they talk about development. But if you check Amadi party government may schedule budget. They have also misused that money for the popular policies and somehow Apui Pataki government school or private school. So this is intervention in schools, but intervention in school making these government schools much better. Ultimately helping those at the lower run. And they are mostly dalits, adivasis and other lower obesity communities which one needs to appreciate. And I particularly when I see reports also because I made they also say it is helping our children.
speaker2 : I've read some of your writings, articles.
speaker1 : Papers.
speaker2 : Caste system and to jab up because after 76 years of independence Abhiham elections and it has become quite clear especially Delhi media caste is the determining.
speaker1 : Factor and you are actually right lake in Muji but caste is not just about behavior. Caste is the political economy of writing, monopoly, caste, colonization, cultural aspect. So for instance, if you look at caste very closely or caste is not about interdependence. It's not just simply interdependence, but it is also the coercive interdependence. Caste is not the simply division of labor with division of laborers. And that is what the indian society division of labor. We could have become a very modern, you know, well functional society. But this is not case with India. For instance, if you see restriction kapahan sakte kanahi pahen sakte kisa shadikar sakte everything is minutely operated within cast system. So there is nothing human. There is nothing human in caste system to isilia or usque usque land raknika dikar kiskas successful nira Abhim Dekteki majority of Dalisa landless and there are huge land in world inequality. And there are many reports which says that the around 85% biliary wealth belongs to upper caste.
speaker2 : Laws. K. Bhavaju actually it has not translated on the ground.
speaker1 : That's what you're saying. Reservation affirmative action introduce Karnakabad radical level.
speaker2 : Hindustan affirmative action Baki Deshonke affirmative action say Alagni wasn't it more forward looking?
speaker1 : But unfortunately, if you see the number of reservations since the beginning or Amita reservation Samajar Shiddul Kaskili Laguniki Kisibi central government in the sense Kagar Samaji jar in Okriah reservation schedule Kaska neighbor therefore there's a backlog central government, huge backlog or whose backlog defense mechanism no matter what happened, because we are an upper class majority hamish institution we don't want any one Joham Kolakta so called rakas so they have developed this idea of not found suitable. We can debate on merit logic, but I don't want to go there right now. The question that you asked me that how caste, caste Agarapko behavioral problems it is not going to work because this is not something obviously that is a part of civility in modern society. You have to be enough civic. You have. You should have a civic sense then. Therefore you have to treat cards caste system therefore, as I say, that traditional caste system that has transformed into the modern institution that you have a complete monopoly of upper caste on all government institution and also so called private institution. So abhi yahape isila hamka caste system to ekto theory maker kahaja system revolution. Revolution. It's a complete change. But we are a democracy right here. We believe in so called gradual change. Our government has run, they run the campaign for everything. Beti bachao beti palau for HIV aids and everything. I haven't seen any government campaign to end the caste. Government have not taken this moral responsibility. Not our political state. Also not even our so called constitutional state. They have not run the campaign. Rather for instance in Europe or in the west. For instance in the US, you see there are different campaigns to end racism except civil society organization dilkitakata forget about jatiwad jatiko katam kari but then koshan kati japan joki API economic so called GSE tax upco dera Abhi Oxford report more than 50% GST is coming from working class who is working classes in this country. Is this working class? Is this low caste? Again the loan kayak report SBI government Joe bank say loan cardinal majority of loan goes to uppercast and rich people. Our business loan month I can send some data with you. And they have applied for so many times. Well educated like in economically sound.
speaker2 : Institution level.
speaker1 : Yes, the caste has. Caste has become the part of your modern institution. For instance, if you check the suicide of Dali student in iits or other institution professor I have seen this and my friends tells me. They tell me that the upper caste professor allegation discrimination kia ask suicide professor class so look at the contempt that they have for the list there is. For instance, this is how if you are a human being, right? But. And if you don't have a contempt. But here our suicide professor class and then he is completely fine with everything and the things are going on. And look at the narratives which are coming from this institution. I recently met one of Dalit girl from Delhi IIT and she was telling me the horrible story that what happened in these institutions which is reproducing system reproduce gender. Gender is not something behavioral problem. For instance, if I am a man, I can be political correct and tell you ma'am, I am so nice to you. But this is is how the genders as a system works. Me being good to you is not going to help you, right? So caste kabi acai caste works as a system. You being good to me is not going to help my community as a. Maybe it's good for me. Maybe you know system co opco reproduce honey constitutional states that has to work. That is not working the way it should work.
speaker2 : So you have been part of an institution apnea PhD Kia so academia discrimination experience discrimination and generally in life. Agarap kahi gar rent anything that you feel that even though you have a PhD rent. So I know vegetarianism. Kebarama puchte I know shadi shudhar maybe.
speaker1 : You can land right.
speaker2 : I've heard that and I've also heard religion kbarimari.
speaker1 : Jabmeka which come kili talash meta yeah mere phamikafi baru jahapi who I chan say if you want to live in at least a so called human condition for instance when I come back so I don't need much residential colony so research most of the metropolitan cities not on the class.
speaker2 : I understand zamin dalit village I know but she.
speaker1 : And you ask them do you get a request that do not give house to dhanits Muslim Katobatha that is very clear. There are many studies on it and there are recent studies on caste also and then you ask them and they will tell you exactly that they get a request. I know in Mumbai one of my relatives was thrown out you know I know one of my friend who studied in jny his father is is and his father hiked to his cars to get a home after his retirement.
speaker2 : I tell you honestly polite society may sublock bad care politics, sophisticated society politicians even those who speak on behalf of the dalit community scheduled.
speaker1 : But now or ye both Sochni valley see for instance we are a society where which is divided on the basis of caste, religion, gender. Right. Just imagine tomorrow if there is a party by women that they think that the main in politics are and they form a political party and tomorrow but now since they don't have enough resources or they don't have enough let's say support in that way to run their political party and they lose all the. Now there are women in other political parties or lake in vogue political party. That's what happening in us. There are Dalit political parties, mainstream issues would happen. Yeah Dalit political parties but somehow we as an indian state, as a modern state haven't taken so society morally fractured society because upper castes are there who dominates to set the rule of morality in our country.
speaker2 : But the prime minister of this country for ten years has not been an upper caste prime minister before that. For ten years you had another prime minister who was not an upper caste prime minister before that also we've had people from the OBC community Johor Rehog, Devikorda, Ji Ho and the others also upper caste community in spite of being from OBC community in spite of being having a dalit as a chief minister of the largest state then the largest state Uttar Pradesh affirmative action ground level.
speaker1 : So up was the only state conviction trade Ramadan when Bainjee was in power she distributed land to landless Dalits and there are many works she has done. If she would have been power again for 20 years. As per the data which speaks with respect to Bahanji and Dalit. She did tremendous work for them. There could be many other things which one can. You know at a policy level. As far as Modi ji is concerned I believe because Joe Saval hai reservation or reservation says I believe that has not been the politics of his party also for longer and also the organization that he belonged. Although he and you know I personally if I because it is a politics and BJP and congress both the majority of people who hold the key power positions are uppercasting in BJP and Congress also OBC is not a social category. It is a constitutional category. You will find many OBCs who have land and they will commit activity on Dalit. You will find many OBCs. You will find few OBC castes in each stage. They are affluent and I believe they should not be in a category.
speaker2 : Especially since you are from Maharashtra. I want to ask you about that also. You have the Maharathas asking they should.
speaker1 : Not be in the OBC. I have a clear stand. They should not be included in OBC.
speaker2 : Anyway let me get to Maharashtra later. But.
speaker1 : Dalit political party for instance since the beginning when it was Srilka's petition power mini Raye like in whatever seats they could win their representative. Even when BSP was in power Bahanji was very strong. And she did what she was supposed to do as a chief minister. But she did a tremendous work as I told you atrocity case may she was very good in that conviction rate. Atrocity meta or atrocity number become abhijo number after UPMA is horrible. Not just up also in Rajasthan when Congress was in power or ABB the BJP power now majority of schedule cast represent is selection. Kipali Abhika exact number Joe reserve seats uppercast late political party. So now they somehow become the surplus union. When trimester comes very strong and he gives a very strong statement. We as a Dalit would always hope Agaram political democracy believe Karatam Yeb Hamara prime minister. You tell me one dalit leader again I am telling you the same thing. This debate will go. That's what I'm saying. This debate will go like this on the Congress. I understand but again you are not treating the system as a system. Caste as a system. As I said Agarap usko muje koi agar Brahman tribes reservation private sector. He will be remembered to buy our community.
speaker2 : So path making step would be Arakshan Johe private sector Nadi Laguna Honachi.
speaker1 : Shetra may population reservation again I'm telling you in any democratic country like us which is based on the caste system whose economy is based on the caste system reservation small reservation botanical which is very true because I have seen on the ground when we are working at the ground I have seen that because see dalit community mostly who you know that is a kind of a prophetic figure for dalit once Ambedkar comes in constitution comes so you cannot separate ambitran constitution and this is so interesting to know the community which is lowest of the low in your country and then you get some leader from BJP if not entire BJP officer statement and you know that work I am not going into that debate Congress but see I bother about my community.
speaker2 : It is a minor.
speaker1 : Thing or something very small negotiation that we have with the indian state now for instance but it's major no it's not a major for instance you tell me in any democratic state if you think you are a democratic modern state so you tell me Joe is desca superficial logan again I am coming Joaquo revenue or joe minute minor care let.
speaker2 : Me come back to it maybe I am misunderstanding it so you mean it's.
speaker1 : A minor request or a minor very small negotiation that we are because see if Merato Hamara dalituka yes indian states do you consider us as a citizen? Do you consider as an equal citizen because society doesn't consider upper caste doesn't consider because data says our everyday reality says that the upper caste do not treat us as equal the way we want. Right now we want to ask that the indian state which is based on the indian constitution do you want to consider as an equal?
speaker2 : Is this a lived experience? Rahul k we are not considered because I have seen a lot of dalit literature on this poems on this invisible I don't exist my mirajo sharir hai vosif ab kelly hai very good. Is this a lived experience that you feel or is it because you interact.
speaker1 : With people who say no see every dalit mostly dalits who are coming from the working class background to a background they have this experience one or other like if I want to tell my story I can tell you number of and this is not just my story if you sit with people from my community Joe Meredith I used to work as aluminum fabric painting Karthiraju Mandir Gharota Banaliya Banika Bhatmi you don't want us to go there surprise maybe when jabapka last menu podcast so for upper caste. Polite upper caste is spectacle. Caste. Always they understand. Caste is spectacle.
speaker2 : It is necessary, Rahul.
speaker1 : No, I am not saying it's not necessary. What I'm trying to say.
speaker2 : Some of us. We stay in cities or insulate.
speaker1 : For urban upper caste. So that is how the system is working for you. Cars. You only understand cars through spectacle. You don't want. And that is how cognitively the operation.
speaker2 : I have not.
speaker1 : Then I agree with you completely. But what I am trying to say. I am trying to give the answer of saying. How do you understand caste? How do I understand caste?
speaker2 : I understand. I get that. I get that Kim Ira experience is not a lived experience. Or I can not understand what you do. But what I can do is what I can support.
speaker1 : Again, how do anyone understand anyone's reality? For instance, you are a woman, you know. But I only understand gender discrimination when there is spectacle on it. Correct. So I am saying hierarchical society. May Joe hierarchy relatively privilege Uski reality. Hamisha spectacle. But I am saying this is another reality. That which I believe that the upper caste always understand caste through spectacle. Otherwise, apostas in post independent India. Have developed collective consciousness around caste. Right? Otherwise, past percent data, metropolitan city. Past percentage become inter caste. Marriage is this may even cities. Maybe so. Caste. Top everyday life in Delhi. If you go outside there. This is agrawal suite. If everyone goes there. We are a caste conscious society. Therefore, I am saying there are two consciousness.
speaker2 : I've seen that five star hotels will never run a Dalit food festival.
speaker1 : I don't even want. They run the Dalit food festival. I want food. Food.
speaker2 : When you talk about the dalit movement. Is it absolutely necessary to be anti brahminical, anti upper caste? Brahminical. Jada bolri. Simply because people say that it invariably becomes an anti brahminical movement.
speaker1 : Brahminical. Brahmin. As you say. For instance, being brahminical. You individually summons the Brahmin.
speaker2 : The practices of.
speaker1 : For instance. I know few of my friends. They are Brahmins. And they are more into dalit movement, you know. But there are few than you know many of my other Dalit middle class people. That is also real. But does that mean the system has changed again? For instance, if I am a man who mirajada Dalit moment. Johan. Anti system moment. It's not anti indigel movement. It's anti system movement. If we agaram system go Kamjur Karthi tapiki mobility or jaram system. This was reality. Social science or science may dono me dropout rate. Dalita Jana faculties science bulwark science generally right wing inclined social science so called left wing CPM, CPI and then ML oriented faculties Johante Wapibui Hale agar is to brahmanical Keval Tikalagi but what about those again the polite upper caste so called liberal upper caste Joe Siksha mehas, Kirk tadati Uruna Kakiya they also have practiced the same thing now Koike Brahmanikal union again therefore this yay institution may jatika or a Kamzuri behavior change therefore Jabab reservation Co reservation Kogarapne policy Banaki or Kirbatma implement OBC Arctic implement Hoga Jo Karnakarlo to Lagua Kanuni rups.
speaker2 : Affirmative action Joe Han on a positive discrimination debate India remained insulated comparison karakte between India and America Bahajo positive action hair USA discrimination hata ki nai with regard to positive action of it or yejo reservation hair.
speaker1 : Reservation to Bharana chay or Pahlibato reservation SAPS mandated by the constitution reservation Isila Balana Hoga Kuki is this may joe population population Kevlar percent Nehru Agarab cast census Karogi to Hamara population around 20% Obisika 50% mandal commission 51% and that is again that's a small negotiation that we have with the state hardly pandra Pradesh Das Pratiski beach meh around 80 90% but the good thing is about America that they have a huge number of whites who support affirmative action. Therefore you don't see much clash of it. There are some writing but even in America that did not become the bigger movie. For instance in America the Black lives matter becomes bigger moment, right? But I am seeing at least at the level of a campaign, at least at the level of consciousness you have a huge lobby of white liberals if you say that and the university is basically agrab american university completely white liberal sky kapna yeh jisme bo racial Joe Representation Professor Kis race is Bhatka full debate or Jada Sanka justify Karthiki representative representation representation they own the media, they own this knowledge industry they have created the negative discourse around affirmative action and that is a part of upper caste anxiety also, you know so privilege myth create for instance when they say popular argument Tunlo Sarkari Jamaica when I was preparing for AI e then in twelve standard Hamara hardly jolapi implement or agri implement hua college Meghan Bushdeh and this is not me who is saying these are studies sociology let me just.
speaker2 : Application data and sarkari job may cast mention but private sector may upennesse mention naikar.
speaker1 : Hair in indian corporate sector mostly uppercase who are beneficiary of so called diversity policy in US also agar unkoi hapi India networks.
speaker2 : Under the ground and intentional.
speaker1 : Also because it's not me who is saying. If you read this study by against do thorathe who was UGC ex chairman and there are other sociologists and political economists who are saying this that agar mujaya apki jati patakarni is not very difficult.
speaker2 : So that is agar mira koi malintention hai apne sangatan organization building if I'm a builder apnea building megarmever mansikta onijaya madhav then you're talking about something which is there in us. It's not. It's not systemic but it is a.
speaker1 : Mental, it is there at as a. You know objective really out there. It is also the part of upper caste cognitive balance that they maintain caste like this for instance they will say.
speaker2 : Hair to fear Abkharioki school, sehatai system.
speaker1 : Sehatai kesehe when at least I believe when there is at least at the level of material reality. Material reality pay java or instance abi agadalito make chota section johanda I know some of my foresters in my city the best surgeon is Dalit. And many people also know that he is Dalit. But just because he's a good they also go to him, right? Because he's a bass surgeon. He's Jan Malka. Exactly. For him he is the power. Why do I want to leave my power? For instance in feminism also when we used to debate in the university my stand used to be like this. Feminism or any women. Women should not to change a man. I'm a you agar a powerful. Nothing is basically about both. Kamlogue Badlaw Shakti sehota power.
speaker2 : Politicians upanya economy Kiwaji Jabapke resources politics Mechana traditional politics Mechana Mushkele ekto Bohe is that the independent name?
speaker1 : Surplus leaders I call them a surplus mainstream may because for instance, you see in the atrocity cases I was on one media China her party Upnik Dalit Nitago her party not this business Congress left everyone. Why can't you tell me? Why can't Dalit become a finance minister? Why can only Dalit become a social distancing minister?
speaker2 : But we had Ram Nath Kovind as president.
speaker1 : No see again even Congress had a Dalit president. Yeah right. But what you know, see if I want to ask you. You know what's the role of president in our country. I am not discrediting, crediting that position. But what I am trying to say. We know actual politics. Kaapar Bhuti who takes a decision and how it happens. How does the parliamentary democracy work?
speaker2 : But do you think that a decision, a finance decision.
speaker1 : That is again the political.
speaker2 : You had a Chidambaram and a Pranamukherjee Brahmins as finance minister. Then you have a Nirmala Sitharaman who is also a Brahmin. Because they are Brahmins and they are finance ministers. They will take anti Dalitz decisions. As far as.
speaker1 : No, no more than anti Dalit. They take a decision, you know in favor of upper caste more. And that goes against the antidilit. For instance, if you know your largely your more than 90% economy is informal economy, right. So in that informal economy the major, major League Dalit Adiwasi, lower OBC. They are employed in farms, landless laboratory and in cities. They are employed in so called MSMe, in small sector industries and in the informal economy. Tell me one single law that any government has brought to reform this position. To reform their economic position. Forget about caste. Just become a blind about caste. But just because they forget about caste people.
speaker2 : Finance ministers. And I forgot. Mister Jaitley was also a Brahmin and finance minister. To subsequent finance ministers. Hamari country Hamari first prime minister. The upper Kaske Brahminki. Decisions which are taken or both malintentions. Any other. It is conditioning up carry. In many cases tokenism is necessary. Hypothetically. Kedate Kimodiji Johe cabinet reshuffle. Dosal meen sal me kardate or a Dalit finance minister. Ajat tokenism.
speaker1 : You are right. You are right. For instance, VP Singh was not obese. He was. But we remember him fondly. That's what I was trying to say.
speaker2 : But I myself have covered his election. My presumption was because of his policies and program.
speaker1 : Consciousness. Now the politics. So we will always fondly remember him. Kibai is victini implement kiata baha protestorata. I don't have much. Unless and until there is a strong movement by lower caste outside there. Or wahasa leadership tokenism. So for instance, we are talking in the absence of having any strong bigger movement outside there. Right. We are talking in the absence of any presence of a strong revolution. So at the end political democracy. But so called political correctness. Kibai hamik. Dalit kedwara. Dalit kwara. Justify Matkara Partica spokesperson.
speaker2 : I'm not saying justify atrocity may ye carry justify this tokenism may ye can tokenism with that intention of tokenism kisiko apne kisi dalit ko ya kisi ob siko apni Chief Minister Banaya Tribal Good Chief Minister Banaya Kamsikam unki joki unki man sikta hai to help their own community.
speaker1 : Accidental things but these are not going to lead to radical changes for instance why sir.
speaker2 : Tribal Chief Minister Banaya to host a education department may tribal school principles this.
speaker1 : Is the case what happened in Punjab when mister chief minister what happened forested in Punjab whatever in short time also you could have done some bigger thing for instance in Punjab the data says that Punjab is a state he could have taken a small risk for we know the so called media criticized being a dalit I know that when she was in power she distributed land also and gharbi sat conviction rate conviction rate.
speaker2 : Because I saw your report I mean what you had written about this see.
speaker1 : If I am a political leader of thakur or Bhumiyar or Maratha how does it work? It works like this that I give you security and what is that? Security is basically I maintain your impunity I am from Maharashtra I can tell you in the case of atrocity in Maharashtra specifically in Marathon the illiterate Maratha have access somehow direct to the RR party then in the cases of atrocities, heinous atrocities saying this is how the network works and therefore they want their caste leader to be there and because they get an impunity and to have that impunity then you need the thanida from your community you need even the local judges you look at that in atrocity cases how does the local judiciary react? You know. You know in the case of bhavi devi case local judicirika ka judgment.
speaker2 : So.
speaker1 : Tomaye karao ki abkoki see we are. We are not a constitutional state. We are a political state and in the political state we the caste matters what dalits what we want that you have a less political state and more constitutional state and when I am saying this exactly what I am trying to say that if the constitution guarantees equality for everyone the government or the state needs to practice that rather what government is doing is practicing the political state what is that? Land owning communities. So even Chenji could not dare to do that because he knows same with any tribal minister for instance in Odisha I am not saying he is doing good because abhito bane but in many other cases and again this is not binary between BJP and Congress. I am seeing this across the political parties even in left political parties most of the dalit leader adivasi leaders were surplus leaders even for instance now Kuyado chief minister Bana but again they might do some small changes but itna operation any data health Apka wikipedia.
speaker2 : National Confederation of Dalit organizations your knack door hair 49% of dalit children in Haryana were malnourished or NFHA report that higher malnutrition is there among dalit and adivasi children. Is this because of poverty only? And is it because also kijo free food grains hair that is not. That's not about giving just free food malnourishment usa bi hora because so isko how can this be changed? What do you suggest?
speaker1 : I believe that the most if you look at the tribal food practices or the mostly local community food practices I am not saying they were very good but at least they could have, you know they could understand. So for instance when you see inflation I remember what my mother said once keep you know hamlog our Mary Rami generally we used to eat beef beef milta abdalobi lagi sastihe or boil kirkani subih that is also to my mother you say kimara bhatchi kamjuri she would make sure that now there are many local practices and here now you have more than political fascism. What danger? I find this food fascism which comes from the urban elite this entire vegan concept which goes very well with the capitalism which goes very well with the present regime also who talks about being vegetarian, right Uska food practice change karuki signing and this is what is happening at the ground level also government is government Kariyaki Hamari Bachoko dal agar postika and abide Kobe mailaev train free hair busy introduced Karnata but again as I said we are a political state we are not a constitutional state. Jahapi hamko ye laktaki hamara president Adivasi why don't we refer this and even not just about one Abhijo political party power even before that also they would say president but they would never utter. Their leader would never utter. You see in your own state Haryana Jabaparaj Rajasthandhe case Dutch Karigla Sarkai report Ktalikumara Sarkar ki Gromantrika or Apna bijo akra Bhattaki Mali Krishna again and in this political state there is no civility. Our political state does not have a civility they only care about power and this power is completely obscene. There is no morality. And there is what again, in Buddhism we call Karuna. I don't see that political, electoral democracy, representation. But again, as you said, it is not going beyond the representation.
speaker2 : Can you tell me now connection between apnea, Buddhism, Kazikiya, between the Dalit movement and Buddhism? I mean, if you want to connect it with Ambedkarji, fine. But for the current generation, for the youngsters today, how does it, how does it work? How does it connect for young dunns?
speaker1 : Oh, he's pleading really well among Dali specifically and also among some lower, they are actually moving towards Buddhism. And this anti conversion law, more than I find it against Muslims or Islam is against Buddhism, because most of the massive open conversion are happening in Buddhism. For instance, in Delhi, Johua Jisky, neo Buddhism.
speaker2 : Neo Buddhism, neo Buddhist, Banjata Buddhism, adopt Katai. Does he stop being a Hindu?
speaker1 : Mostly, at least ideologically. For instance, religiously. Navi ho, in the sales case, I being new about this, I don't lose my reservation, right? Maybe that fear is also there, as far as I know. So Lakin, ground lakin, ideological change. There is a God who does not love you. God. If I am not able to enter in your temple, if I am not allowed. So the explanation has been given. This is the analysis of karma in Kasusha. And therefore, God doesn't love you. Now, here is a God, if not exactly God, but the guru who said that I love him and my. And with Buddhism, with youth, why it connects?
speaker2 : Isn't that a misinterpretation? That God doesn't love you because you are of a born?
speaker1 : It's not my interpretation. This is what the manusmurti says. You see, there are temples, there are cases every day.
speaker2 : Of course there is.
speaker1 : No, you come with me. You come with me in my state and you tell them that you are a dalit. And you see, if that pandit allows you to enter into that temple, I can take you many temples in Maharashtra. Forget about other states. So called my Maharashtra progressive state. I can take you many temples.
speaker2 : Did your parents convert to Buddhism or did you convert?
speaker1 : No, my nana, my father. So it happened in 1956. So my nana converted my, my dada. So he passed away when my father was very small. So anyway, the entire community converted.
speaker2 : So you grew up as a Buddhist?
speaker1 : Yeah.
speaker2 : Right. Now, when you grow up as a Buddhist and you are a dalet, do you. Do you celebrate festivals? Do you hindu festivals? Do you, do you do practices which are connected with Hinduism? Or does your, does neo Buddhism tell.
speaker1 : You not to no, we generally now when like for instance in my family, particularly around we don't practice any Hinduism. So. And we celebrate our buddhist, for instance, from our birth to death. There are buddhist ceremonies. So if you know, in Maharashtra, Parna. So in Parna Mahila, Sabar Buddha. So in death also there is Buddha Vandana, which happens. So that has completely, at least in. Among new Buddhists in Maharashtra, I can tell you they don't many of them. If there are, there are also compulsive. For instance, I am living in a society which is mostly Apaka Sindhi society. I don't want to get Alin. Then I also celebrate two practices.
speaker2 : But inter societal practices are nothing. Family practices. Family may apnea kat in the sense.
speaker1 : That even Hamari marriage, we call her buddhist monk everything. And that's how marriage. I say that is a comment. But I am seeing more than anti hindu. They are there too. Because there is this very concept of that you are two equal human being. For instance, if I ask my mother, so most of dalit women, they go to Buddha vira in evening and they do Buddha Ventra and all of that. My mother says, my nani was never allowed to go to temple in the evening. My nana was a meal worker and there were only two dalit families in that colonies. So my nanny was never allowed to go to the near temple and sit like the other non dalit women would sit and do the pratna. But my mother says, you know, this is what. And she did not give me the analysis. But she was telling me, I asked her, she is very active in Buddha Vera committee acceptance or Bhagal may colony hamarity. So you see now these dalit women, like for instance, my mother was a construction worker. They got this space which was never given to them. And respectable, respectable. Their own space. They don't have to ask anyone for that respectable piece for that space also.
speaker2 : Please don't misunderstand, but I want to ask you. It's a sensitive question about attire because I asked this when I was speaking to Dilip mandal. Also when we were talking. And there's a lot that goes about attire. Now you tell me the connection. Joe Bhim Raoji, when he used to wear two piece suit, right usque baath, the whole concept of attire. Dilip ji says that cleanliness, it is such a big thing.
speaker1 : But he must be mentioning about the upper caste lacking the civic sense, but.
speaker2 : Connecting that the person whose job it is to clean the sewage, also your sewage, public sewages underground. It is lower caste people who are doing it right. I don't want to. When I say upper caste, lower caste. I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I mean. But it is the truth. So ye attire.
speaker1 : No, no.
speaker2 : See cleanliness. These are important aspects.
speaker1 : No irbit, crate movement per se. This attire thing. Because there is this very famous debate between. Or if you come to Maharashtra there are Ambedkar eight song that you know. Ambedkar wearing thai coat. And Gandhi is in half naked volume. So. But somehow I am little critical about this popular Dalit disputes. Because I believe somehow it has become more identical. And this is too much having pressure performing Dalit. Now if you know, for instance I am Dalitze. I have to wear coat type. And then only I will look assertive Dalit. It is too much to prove myself. I am like Dalit is also human being. I want to also wear very thin clothes in summer. I also want to wear, you know, the good clothes. So that my body get covered in winter. I want to also chill. What is this Dalit food. I also want to eat. What is best is nothing called Dalit food. Because these are.
speaker2 : But there are now books which have come out.
speaker1 : That is what I am very critical about it. I don't think this is true.
speaker2 : Because it's just another viewpoint. I am.
speaker1 : No. That is how this popular discourse. You know mostly becomes popular because of culture. And I have problem with celebrating this kind of culture. Dalit food, dalit achar, dalit pulo. Nonsense. What is best? Dalit should do that as you said. And there should be no pressure also. For instance, this is a time where. And therefore I believe. Okay. That was a time when Baba saban Kanshiram sab shirt pant panki chapel penk. Why this two. So I'm saying I agree with you that amusko doki jovi karna school college. Jana Dalita Garibu is paying like in my karaki. Then entire discourse becomes about simply the small celebration. Blind celebration of identity. I am seeing with Dalit. Question is the bigger question of political economy. If you resource listen. Agar maya hua kal meharmara. They might go to some good places, right? Unko bataniki, zarbatni hogi mujiki. Deliberately. For instance Abhijo is officer doctor. They are equally celebrating a life. What other middle class or upper middle class person do I have seen that I would like to have the understanding or the books around like this. When the upper caste person tell daughter or their son about caste. They start telling that how we have benefited from the caste system that why I am here is not just because of my so called marry, but how the entire system has also helped me, my family and the generation to be here. And therefore, the privileges that you are having not knowing the caste is also because of this that we have a privilege. But at least conversation to Shuram perspective.
speaker2 : Was there in your school.
speaker1 : Yes. Big person singer Jomatang Samasayata, second to Babura Bagul. All of these people, they're known people.
speaker2 : Translations. It's 76 years.
speaker1 : Yeah, I know it's taking a long time. But again, what I'm trying to say.
speaker2 : Why you are a PhD? Why didn't you.
speaker1 : Obviously I'll do that. See.
speaker2 : I'm sorry, I'm asking.
speaker1 : We should do that. But I'm asking you because I'm very bad in translation. Again, I don't want to tell this, but see, I come from a Nakpurka north. Nakpurka slum, jahape namiri hindi, achie, namiri, marathi.
speaker2 : I can tell you three languages.
speaker1 : To mujikisi lakai. Again, yes, but English at the end become a very. I love English language. Because it is more easier, at least while reading to understand. And you are right. Hamko transit karnatakar muji Washington. But again, I will emphasize.
speaker2 : They should also come forward. We don't talk about lived experiences like what you are talking about.
speaker1 : Now. I am saying caste is such a. Has become a perfect guilt, politically correct commodity that most of the so called liberal Ott content of our director want caste to be presented in the news, gender to whoa. Abhita kebab new commodity. Because in this time, in this political correct time, you want the new spectacle reality. Now caste has that spectacle which can be seen, which can be, which can be awarded. You might get award somewhere in us or up. That is how the entire political correctness is working, which is absolutely fine. What my perspective is this that the caste works more as a political economy in a country. And therefore, unless and until, as you said, Job, samjari, API Galti, nayi. It is also the mistake somewhere. Dalit thinker, Dalit intellectuals also that they want upper caste to understand caste through their personal story, which is which somewhere was fine. But now the time has arrived how upper caste have benefited from the caste system. And they should understand caste system from there. Okay, right. My point is this. And then only what you said, caste. Katham Mugae cast. I say, Kathy, when you understand a system through their, you know, origin system, if you want to understand how race colonization happened in us, you cannot simply understand through the black stories. But you also have to understand that how white are benefited now, how generational wealth they created by that operation.
speaker2 : Okay to the to the end. I just want to ask you two questions. One, caste census hona chaye nai hona chaye or kabhona chaye is the time right right now to do the caste census egg vo dusra for our external audiences. Also explain to me why it was necessary to change the word from untouchable to Harijan, from Harijan to Bahujan and Dalit. What is that? What are the three, what are the terms and why are these important?
speaker1 : First question is about kasads. So as we know at the level of policy in every modern democratic state, in the policy literature, if you know they give importance to fact, then only you can design the policy. There is this concept of target in a population in the social policy. So if you do not know the fact about your own people, for instance, if you are making a policy or budget for your own people, you do not know. So then the policy will always have a flaws, right? So policy purpose he cast we are very vocal about caste when it comes to politics. Therefore in political state for political parties and political cadence for them caste becomes very important. All the only problem we have to bring caste in a constitutional state. Constitutional state Kamatlabe Jap cast ko ginoge or cast around Usko Uski policies Banawata Kiske Pascah or Uskamatlavini may society may balance jada barega to Kisibi democratic state kili danger Osakta for instance no government want Kyunke Khila Prasad protest no government want that or maybe.
speaker2 : Discontents.
speaker1 : I believe in a democratic state negotiation and otherwise things will go haywire right? And I don't want and number patakarnikali censorship or censor Islam kapark and they have created me throughout reservation if you just have a, you know for instance census or population Kiski Kitney Congress Congress Bhalai campaign make in Congress Unkajuda even Dohajar Garakaju socioeconomic data you look at the valid name Agrabuski website to see how the conspiracy works or Mujabi Congress Congress may conflict Congress may promise ko Congress within uppercast or Usma conflict Congress lobby so IsIli cast census Bo Jarujiki political state Balajatiki Bhatkarta constitutional state Kapatna census Banjaga constitutes state Kapadh policy a party b party c party and that is very important where I said that we need a more constitutional state and less political state. Okay.
speaker2 : And now the terminology.
speaker1 : So see in. If I am a student of sociology and I believe that every marginalized community, they want some category of. So when Gandhi gave this category of origin, I am not saying his intention was purely bad. But that category again come from that guilt ridden Aparaka's mind, right. Seva and Babasa criticized that, you know, that ki agar, you know. And there is no idea of. Right. You know, for instance, when you say harijan, it has to do with the, you know, some God and the relationship with the people. So they say both we, as a modern indian state, I need to have a category which defines my existence rightfully not divine through divinity. You are a human being. I am human being. Therefore, this category, like Dalit, it came from a moon and the moment which was very uncertain. Although the word was used by Baba sahib also, if not frequently, but sometime and also by others, scholars and the ladies. But Dalit world became more popular with Dalit Panther movement. And the Dalit Panther association is also tells us that we too can become militant if it is required. We are not this polite survivor. We are a Dalit who are coming from the sewer and telling you that you better need to stop it. Otherwise I will drag you here also. So Dalit is that powerful word, you know, which Dalit Panther represents. So therefore, it became the popular word also among many marginalized Dalit community. Not among all the Sridhul caste, but also among. But at least among those Sridhul caste community who are. Who are at forefront to fight against the caste. As far as Bhowjan is concerned, I believe.
speaker2 : But yours is not your president of the All India Independent Scheduled Caste association.
speaker1 : Because there are many scheduled caste communities who may not want. Who may not right now associate with the word dali. Because they may not as assertive as like in UP. You know, there are some communities who are scheduled caste. But they might not want to associate.
speaker2 : With Dalit moment or umbrella.
speaker1 : Now tell me about the Bahujan so bhajan word. If you read, for instance, I studied pali in my 12th, 11th, twelve standard. So there is this word always come. Bhaojan ita baojan. So the origin of Bhowjan comes from Buddhism. That you know that the majority of. Because marginalized always dudhaka, bhaojanita, bhaojan, sita. So bhaojan that time was not necessarily political sense metha. But yeh thaki sabi janoka.
speaker2 : In that bahujan.
speaker1 : But now when this term gain currency. Specifically when Kanchiram sahib and I khapadi sahib and all other bamshe pleader. They form bamse in 1970 around and then this, this word gained this popularity and got this political tamki. Bhujan means the oppressed majority were lower caste Mulnivasi and then there is the opposite camp. The ruling minority were upper caste right. So pachasi pandravalajo formula which became popular. So I believe which is a very good in any political democratic country where someone is basically concentrating the majority of offers that you too have a power to become ruling community in this country. You are not simply the old bank, you are not simply Dalit old bank. You are not simply Muslim World bank, you are not simply adivas old bank.
speaker2 : In Bahujan you have Muslims also you might have Pasmanda Muslims, you might have the Dalit seats, Dalit Christians. Everybody comes in to politically be that when now Mayawati jihad when she talks that that comes under the Bahujan umbrella.
speaker1 : Yes, yes but largely. But it's not about just BSP or now about Bahnji but as you asked me about this particular terminology. So as a student of sociology or political sociology if I want to answer your question I believe that this very term bhowjan has, you know, provided a new consciousness to the lower caste communities where the shift of the political consciousness happened where for long, for long, for longer time. You are not, you are not oppressed minority but you are operas majority. Therefore your bhujan, you are SCSt OBC minority. You are a bhujan. YouTube. Oppressed majority and there is something called ruling upper caste minority who are there. So you too can become a politically powerful and I believe it has that importance.
speaker2 : Do you have any hopes they will do something? Because it has been a shocking result for the ruling party and more muscle for people from oppressed societies who have got elected because for whatever reason it happened. So 18th Lok Sabha it is a better representation of the Dalit population. Would you say that?
speaker1 : I think yes. Like compared to previous government where opposition was not that strong and now I also see there are very vocal voices from Dalit and OBC background also. At least I believe, you know I don't because we cannot have much hope from opposition but how much hope from the ruling party and government now as we know, as I told you, if you will see the data, see as I said issues khaki you know forest reservation. So this is our. We are hoping that this particular government Abhi Kuki opposition be strong. And now they also have realized that the Dalits if you are not with them. If you are simply having their token representative, you know, and simply, you know, going around with this hindu muslim binary. Dalit and other lower caste are not going to be in that trap for a longer time. Because their needs that and their condition is very this objective reality, right. If majority of Dalits are living in poverty, if they are facing discrimination, then they want something concrete for them. And therefore I believe that the. If this government push for a, you know, reservation in private sector, I believe then there will be huge changes politically. If I have to speak, you know, I am not a community. And Dalit community is a Sachi community. They don't forget. For instance, fully is now for Mali community. But if you go in Maharashtra, you will find full time Hamko, Hamari Ghravali. But javam pada picture Shah Maraji Maratha king hamletika tantric babaka photo lagai hamarity. So this is how we remember. And I want. See, I want this government should be remembered like this. If they do this thing, if they implement reservation private sector, if they fulfill backlog of, you know, assist to OBC, we will remember them for. Right.
speaker2 : Rauchi, there's one question which is always asked when people talk about reservation. Is that meritocracy?
speaker1 : Yeah, this question as we know. But before answering directly to this question, we also need to understand that this very logic of Mary is also part of upper caste anxiety. And it began with when they. When the government or indian state implemented reservation. And reservation is a constitutional reservation. It's not something a political party, assembly, preservation, factual data Abitak to Marini Dekai Sakti Bhatumi reservation. But tell me one case study or like give me the data. So data ki subsidy will pronounce. Rather I can. Rather the counter argument can be given that the education is mostly handled by government. Education is handled by upper caste. Your economy is handled by upper caste. Yours, most of the institution. And the condition is really bad. Okay, so mirika, logic, you are having monopoly but still you are not able to improve the condition. Now again, I don't want to even go into that argument. Women reservation. Agarap ye kahte ho keep women. Because women are not there in the parliament or they are not there mostly in the big, bigger position in the euro economy. Because there are structural barriers to it. And the structural barriers are not invisible. There are people who are structural barrier. There is a structure of patriarchy which is a structural barrier for me, which does not allow them, the people who actually do not allow them to go for the higher pollution. Similarly with the caste system. If the. As I said, if caste would have been simply about, you know, middle class resources. My position is Mayapco reservation, reservation possibility or data. Majority of dalits. For instance, if you even check the UPC interview number. Dalit students, OBC Dalit students. They do good in the written exam. But they get less mark in the interview. Similarly, when I was in JNU, I checked the same thing. That the majority of Dalit. Those who get into the university or junko navy Milta admission. They do good in the written exam. So it is not about merit, about opportunity.
speaker2 : For example a Brahmin student or other student from a Brahmin family. Agarwo lower middle class poor family. Sebi 89% 90% le kayata or a dalit student 40% lake reservation ke kota, mebu chalice percent usko bak degree Kelly admission Mil Jayagi Joe 89%.
speaker1 : Again this is a myth that the upper caste created and out of anxiety. Now for instance there is a reservation, right. For dalis. Let's say 49% something pashas. Pratish population. Kitna pandra pratisha, sebikam. Though pandra pratisha, Keju Logh community kachas Pratish or Pachasi Pratisha population 49% reserved or abd. Even jabi rule ta schedule Kasia student to general category. May number millach admission milla generally institution. Make sure kartaki reservation. K under uskaja easily. Intermica marks ojaga like namali. Even Johagaro park. Particular categories. General category medalio or jada logic. Okay. Competition of uppercase. Dalit ke satnijara competition upper kaska sati satni. Abhiyanagar chare Agarapi agar koi studenthood. Kogi Agarap jnuk entrance OBC general category Kaju Katani, Karamisa bina Data reservation. Anti reservation is Joe pura propaganda. They opposed OBC reservation. Where Abi olo Kahaga general categorical ews reservation. Did you see a single proof? So uppercase is not against the reservation. They are against the reservation for OBC. Because general category rasta roga or Abhikmaripas data. But as vitna melogos implement. Joe cable or cable. Brahmin or baki or both. Come Joe income.
speaker2 : Shouldn't it be more widespread? Ews.
speaker1 : Ews no aptoka reservation to merit. KB.
speaker2 : I'm not saying it.
speaker1 : I'm just saying reservation. There I to apologize again. I'm saying key. In any stratified society, the logic of merit is not a logic is basically defense mechanism, right? Similarly the white, there are the right wing whites in us also. They oppose the positive, you know, discrimination for racially, you know, minority communities. And this is because in any stratified you don't have any mechanism to uplift them. This is because if there is a structural barriers, upcoming structural barriers or structural barriers.
speaker2 : Reservation is the only one.
speaker1 : Agar Dusra veni to kira evolution kranti overthrow overthrow. Kivojin Saktami social justice or ye sapi zarvatini.
speaker2 : Jabab J and you may say satamedo election Abniki bahari election nay manito.
speaker1 : Nahiki political party name naya Vitaktuni when he was in JNU he was my, I guess two years seniors maybe election lada or Kanya Dojar Pandra election to.
speaker2 : Both electoral politics Nichole because there are.
speaker1 : More avenues for upper caste. Anyway in electoral politics I will get more value in any political party. When there will be atrocity on Dalit and I am leading that atrocity justice, then they will recognize me. They will recruit me.
speaker2 : On that note, thank you so much raoji aapai and apnea kafi sari misconceptions or I am sure viewers and you gave me a perspective which I hope has improved my understanding of Dalitsh.
speaker1 : Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
